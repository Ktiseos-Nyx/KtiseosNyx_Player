# KtiseosNyx_Player
A fairly simple audio player in PyQT6 with playlist support. Extremely in development, BE AWARE the volume implimentation isn't likely working no matter how much documentation i read up on.
Basically stating: Listener beware, you'll get your eardrums shot in 30 seconds flat.


You'll need a wide array of things, but since this is not likely to be FINISHED nor fixed due to the lack of nesscesity (sometimes I make things based on if it can be done rather than should be)... 
I won't re-do the readme until later.
